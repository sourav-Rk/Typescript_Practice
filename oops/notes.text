CLASS
------
* A class in TypeScript is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods. 
  It supports object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.


4 PILLARS OF OOPS

1. ENCAPSULATION
2. POLYMORPHISM
3. ABSTRACTION
4. INHERITANCE


----ENCAPSULATION------
* ides the internal state and behavior of an object from the outside world and only exposes a 
controlled interface.
*To protect internal data from direct access or modification.

*To provide controlled access via getters/setters.

*To reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

*To ensure data integrity and security.

in TypeScript encapsulation is mainly achieved through : 
=> access modifiers
=> getters and setters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----INHERITANCE----------
* Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where one class (child or derived class) 
inherits properties and methods from another class (parent or base class).

* It allows for code reuse, method overriding, and hierarchical class structures.
